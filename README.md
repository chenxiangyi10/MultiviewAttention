# MultiviewAttention

## Overview

MultiviewAttention is a research project that implements attention mechanisms for multiview attention for surgical instruments recognition. This repository will contain the official implementation of our approach along with the datasets used in our experiments.

## Current Status

**Note:** This repository is currently under preparation pending publication acceptance.

### Dataset and Code Access

The dataset and code are currently shared on OneDrive: 
- Link: https://1drv.ms/f/c/e3f805f0fd961271/EhO0ceVOva1JkaHt5yPa6e0BaasSBinZmcejsjXgWlnmTA?e=LiHMYZ
- Access code: Available in the submitted manuscript (currently under review)

Once the paper is accepted, the code will be moved to this repository and the dataset will be made publicly accessible without requiring an access code.
